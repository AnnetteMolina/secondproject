Long ago, there lived a young boy named {name1}. {name1} was a poor {occupation}, living in the village with his mother. One day, his mother became very ill, and he decided he needed to do everything in his power to help her. Lacking money, he called on his friends for favors, who explored the town for a possible cure for her mysterious illness.

{name1}’s friend, {name2}, ran back to {name1}’s house. “{name1}! The local witch said she would help.”

{name1} gasped. “There is no way we are getting help from a witch!”

“Come on, do you want your mother to live or not?” responded {name2}. {name1} huffed, but he reluctantly agreed.

Walking together, the two boys walked to the witch’s house. The witch let out a cackle upon seeing the boys. Walking over to her cauldron, she looked at {name1}. “So, you are in need of my help?” she said, her voice sounding like fire crackling. {name1} nodded, looking at the witch in fear. The witch smiled.

“Very well, but you need to follow my directions carefully. In order to pay for saving your mother’s life, you must sacrifice another. You must travel to castle {castle_name} and bring me the heart of the king.”

The boy gasped, “The heart of the king? I cannot kill him!”

The witch growled. “Only death can pay for life!” she cried out, “Now, go!”

{name1} scurried out, with {name2} at his heels. {name2} looked at his dear friend. “I will go with you.”

“No,” said {name1}, solemnly. “This is something I have to do myself. I won’t have blood on your hands.”

Traveling to {city_name}, {name2} looked around for any clues that led to the secret castle entrance. Specifically, a(n) {adjective1} {noun1} was rumored to be able to teleport people to the secret tunnels. Looking at the different shops in the city center, he finally found a(n) {adjective2} looking man who seemed to know about the {adjective1} {noun1}. He approached the man, but the man hissed at him. Not feeling very brave, {name1} ran away.

After looking for a while, the boy admitted defeat. He dejectedly walked away from the city center, towards the woods. As he was walking, he heard a(n) {adjective3} voice. Heading towards it, he noticed a glowing pond. The voice called out, “Tell me of your truest desire.”

The boy teared up, feeling as if he could trust the voice. He reached out and touched the water, then the water began to swirl. He saw his own reflection in the water, slowly becoming distorted. {name1} felt {emotion}; what could this be? He tried to remove his hand, but he lost his balance. After falling in the water, he felt it swirling around him.

The last thing the boy remembered was the bright blue water surrounding him, before he was tossed out of the water. He got up and started to {verb1}, almost as if in a trance. He quickly snapped out of it, then ran all the way home.

He approached his mother, who suddenly looked as healthy as a(n) {animal}! Confused, {name1} asked about her illness, to which she responded with, “What do you mean?” Turning to look at his own reflection, he noticed he looked completely different. Gone were his scruffy, tattered clothes. Instead, he looked younger, healthier, and stronger. He looked around at his newfound riches, and he felt a sudden urge to {verb2}. What world had he been transported to? He quickly hugged his mom, who hugged him in return. Though he wished to celebrate, the words the witch told him rang in his ears. “Only death can pay for life.”
