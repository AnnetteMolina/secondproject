    I was so {adjective1} today that I forgot to pack my lunch!
    So, I grabbed whatever I could find in the kitchen and made a sandwich with {food1}, {food2}, and a slice of {noun1}.
    Then I added a squirt of {liquid}, a handful of {plural_noun1}, and smushed it all between two pieces of {adjective2} bread.
    When I brought it to school, my friend {person_name1} said it looked like a {animal}.
    I took one bite and immediately felt {emotion1}.
    It made a sound like a {noun2} when I chewed it, and I may have turned slightly {color}.
    I guess next time Iâ€™ll just pack a normal lunch!
