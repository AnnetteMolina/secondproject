Yesterday was the most {adjective} day of my life. I woke up to the sound of a(n) {animal} knocking at my door. 
Thinking it was my {family_member}, I got up and opened the door to find the {animal} doing flips across my hallway. 
At first, I thought I was dreaming, so I crawled back into bed and tried to fall asleep. However, a bright light came from outside. 
I looked out the window and saw a group of {plural_noun} having a picnic on my front lawn!

Not knowing what else to do, I decided to join them, so I put on my favorite {adjective2} hat and grabbed a {noun} from the kitchen. 
As I stepped outside, I accidentally tripped over a(n) {silly_object} and landed face-first in a puddle of {liquid}. 
The {animal}s came out of nowhere and started to laugh at me.

Feeling offended, I huffed and went back inside, where I found a(n) {animal2} sleeping in my bed! I sighed and gave up, crawling in next to it. 
I grabbed my teddy bear and fell back asleep. After I woke up, I realized I was sleeping alone again. 
I looked out my window, and all of the animals were gone. However, they left behind their mess, which my mother is blaming me for. 
Who would even believe me if I told them the truth!
