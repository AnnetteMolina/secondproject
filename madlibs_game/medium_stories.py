    I was excited for camp at {place1}, but everything went wrong the second we arrived. My tent was full of holes and smelled like {smell1}.
    During the first night, I found {plural_noun1} crawling all over my sleeping bag, and a raccoon stole my {food1}.
    On the hike the next morning, I tripped on a {noun1}, fell into a bush of {plural_noun2}, and had to wear a leaf as a bandage.
    "{exclamation1}!" I yelled, sliding down a muddy hill straight into the lake. Everyone laughed, but at least the water washed off the {adjective1} goo from my legs.

    Later that evening, we roasted {plural_noun3} over the campfire and told scary stories.
    One was about a {adjective2} ghost named {person_name1} who haunted abandoned cabins and screamed like a {animal1}.
    Just as the story ended, we heard a {sound1} in the woods. Everyone panicked and ran into the {structure1} at once, knocking over a pot of {liquid1}.
    I accidentally put on someone else's {clothing_item} and wore it backwards all night.
    Camp was definitely {adjective3}, but I made new friends — and a lasting fear of {insect1}.

    This year’s science fair at {school_name1} was the weirdest one yet.
    I built a robot that could {verb1} and {verb2} using just {plural_noun1} and an old {electronic_device1} I found in my garage.
    My best friend {person_name1} made slime that turned {color1} and made fart noises when stretched.
    Another student used {food1} to create a functioning {noun1}, which exploded halfway through judging.
    The judges looked {adjective1}, and one of them nearly spilled their {drink1} in shock.

    When my turn came, I got so nervous I {verb3_past} and dropped my robot on {teacher_name1}’s shoes.
    Everyone gasped, but then she {verb4_past} and said it was the most {adjective2} thing she’d ever seen.
    To top it off, a group of students did a live demo with {animal1}s and a makeshift volcano powered by {substance1}.
    I ended up winning third place and a trophy shaped like a {noun2}.
    We all celebrated with {dessert1}, and I promised myself I’d go even bigger next year — maybe with lasers and a flying {vehicle1}.
